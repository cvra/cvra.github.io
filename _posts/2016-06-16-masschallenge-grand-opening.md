title: CVRA at the MassChallenge Switzerland Opening
---

Last friday, a few team members and Debra were invited to present the robot at the inauguration of the MassChallenge startup accelerator.
This accelerator aims to be the most startup-friendly on the planet, by providing entrepreneurs with the ressources needed to take their companies to the next level.
MassChallenge will last 4 month and it will be installed just a few meters away from the CVRA.

During the opening, Debra was tasked with an important job: giving the inauguration scissors to Anne-Catherine Lyon, member of the Council of State of Vaud and to Marianne Huguenin, Mayor of Renens.
It was started using the classical Eurobot cord by Philippe Leuba, member of the Council of State of Vaud.

This was an excellent opportunity for us to present our activities to local politicians as well as members of the tech industry.
We would like to thank MassChallenge Switzerland, Inartis and Univercit√© for inviting us.
