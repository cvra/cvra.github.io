Today [@SyrianSpock](https://github.com/syrianspock/) tweaked the navigation stack used in our small robot (codenamed "Goldorak" for now).
Our code is based on the [Robot Operating System](http://www.ros.org/), which allowed us to quickly develop our pathfinding system.
We will try to say more about it in another post, but for now... demo!
