            <p>
            As every year we took part in the Eurobot 2017 contest, held in Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland.
            We entered the contest with one robot: Debra, in its 7th iteration.
            Some reliability issues prevented our robot from reaching its full potential, we finished 9th.

            This year's goal is to make robots build a better city.
            Your mission, should you accept it, will consist of:
            <ul>
                <li>Using building blocks (colored cubes) to build towers according to the plan.</li>
                <li>Collecting water (colored balls) and dispatching it in a water tower of a waste treatment area depending on its quality.</li>
                <li>Activate an exclusively electrical domotic panel.</li>
                <li>Activate an exclusively mechanical bee that will forage a flower.</li>
                <li>Estimate the score achieved by the robots.</li>
            </ul>
            </p><p>More details about the new contest in the <a href="/ressources/rules/2018.pdf">rules</a>.</p>
