            <p>
            As every year we took part in the Eurobot 2016 contest, held in Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland.
            We entered the contest with two different robots, collaborating to win the game.
            Some reliability issues prevented our robot from reaching their full potential, and we were ranked 12th.

            <p>
            In March 2016, ESA (European Space Agency) has revealed its Moon Village project which will take place in 20 years.
            The goal is to build a permanent plant on the Moon surface with resources gathered in situ.</p><p>
            It is within this context that your robots will set out to conquer the Moon!</p><p>
            Your mission, should you accept it, will consist of:
            <ul>
                <li>Collecting titanium ores extracted from the lunar soil and collecting lunar modules sent back from Earth by rockets.</li>
                <li>Building a Moon base with the help of the lunar modules sent from Earth and the ones already presents on the Moon.</li>
                <li>Funny action: launching a spacecraft in order to prepare flights leaving for planet Mars.</li>
            </ul>
            </p><p>You can find more information about the new contest in the <a href="/ressources/rules/2017.pdf">rules</a>.</p>
