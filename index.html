            <p>
            We started the season by participating the Belgian Eurobot competition.
            Then, we played the Swiss national contest and <b>won second place</b> (see picture).
            That qualified us for the world cup in France, where we reached the <b>quarter finals</b>.
            Finally, we won third place in the friendly Ile-de-France cup.
            </p>

            This year's goal is to make robots build a better city.
            Your mission, should you accept it, will consist of:
            <ul>
                <li>Using building blocks (colored cubes) to build towers according to the plan.</li>
                <li>Collecting water (colored balls) and dispatching it in a water tower of a waste treatment area depending on its quality.</li>
                <li>Activate an exclusively electrical domotic panel.</li>
                <li>Activate an exclusively mechanical bee that will forage a flower.</li>
                <li>Estimate the score achieved by the robots.</li>
            </ul>
            </p><p>More details about the new contest in the <a href="/ressources/rules/2018.pdf">rules</a>.</p>
