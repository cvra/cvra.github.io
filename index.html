            <p>
            We started the season by participating the Belgian Eurobot competition.
            Then, we played the Swiss national contest and <b>won second place</b> (see picture).
            That qualified us for the world cup in France, where we reached the <b>quarter finals</b>.
            Finally, we won third place in the friendly Ile-de-France cup.

            This year's goal is to make robots collect and discover atoms.
            Your mission, should you accept it, will consist of:
            <ul>
                <li>Collecting atoms and sorting them by weight.</li>
                <li>Use a particle accelerator to discover a new heavier element.</li>
                <li>Activate an experiment to project an electron.</li>
                <li>Estimate the score achieved by the robots.</li>
            </ul>
            </p><p>More details about the new contest in the <a href="/ressources/rules/2019.pdf">rules</a>.</p>
