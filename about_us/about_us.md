<p>
CVRA is a group of students and engineers passionate about robotics. It is based in Renens, Switzerland.
We build autonomous robots as part of the European robotics competition Eurobot.
Our members come from different backgrounds, thus bringing skills and knowledge to the club in various fields such as mechanical engineering, manufacturing, electronics and software.
This allows us to build relatively complex robots such as Debra, our main competing robot since 2011 featuring two articulated arms.
