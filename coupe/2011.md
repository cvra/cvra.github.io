# Eurobot 2011: Chess'Up!

<div class="row">
<div class="large-6 columns">

<blockquote>
<p>
This year we are playing chess, sort of. As we're playing a special kind of chess...
In our chess game you can stack the pawns to have more points.
The goal is to have more points on squares of your own color that opponent has on its
own at the end of the match.
But be careful! All can change in the last second!
</p>

<p>
The robot with the most pawns on its color wins!

# Nos robots

<p>
This year we started working on an universal robot concept, that we will reuse from year to year.
It has a robotic arm on each side with succion cups to grab playing elements.
We can store an stack of pawn on the front and one on the back.
