#General
* Honestly assess your skills, time and budget
* KISS: Keep it Simple and Stupid
* Base meta: reliable robots win
* Two robots for first year are big no no
* Beacons ?
* You should know where to cut corners. If you don't, read the rest.

#Mechanics

I strongly advise you against cutting corners when building / buying the wheelbase of your robot.
A quality base will really help you reach a good level of precision when moving around on the table and will be easier to work with.
You can find our current design [on our GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/library/differential-wheels-platform-for-mobile-robot-1).
If you have any questions about the design just ask.

Encoders on the motor's shaft are easy to use but if your robot slips  you will loose precision. This can be avoided using encoders on a second set of wheel (you can see it on one of our robots below.

You should stick to quality hardware for motors and sensor if you can afford it. Buy from known brands: Sick, Baluff, Baumer for the sensors and Maxon or Faulhaber for the motors. If you are willing to spend some time searching, eBay can be a good source to buy them cheaply (secondhand should not be a problem with this type of hardware).

#Electronics

#Software

For the software I think you have already enough knowledge to program your robot. My main advice is to keep it simple here and only do complicated stuff later.

#Conclusion

* Don't hesitate to send us questions via email

I plan to write a blog post with advices for Eurobot newcomers so if you have any questions or need advice on something I would be happy to answer and add it to the site.
